Welcome to "The Big O". Please be free to revisit and improve our fun little project that experiments the use of OSC messages to communicate parameters from one program to another (but also from one PC to another!). We used OSC messages sent from the TrackingColor program to manipulate some parameters in an Ableton Live project and then from there sent other messages to TheBigO program to manipulate the appearence of the ellipse.

For those that have Ableton Live you should have "Max for Live" in order to use the .adg project, but don't worry if you don't have it! Just have fun sending OSC messages to other programs! You can run the two programs as they are and see the tracking changing the axis of the ellipse. You can choose to use a video or the webcam to track a color.

The code is filled with comments so that you can understand what we have done and what you can do and change!

If you have any questions be free to stop us (Francisco, Giuliano and Carlo) in class or write to francisco.messina@mail.polimi.it, or through WhatsApp if you have our number ;)

Final comment, for the Ableton project I suggest you to read the documentation online on how to use the OSC controllers (https://www.ableton.com/en/packs/connection-kit/)

Have fun!
